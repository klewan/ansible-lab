Ansible Playbooks written in YAML language

YAML designed to represent data structures in easy-to-write, human-readable format
	Examples: Lists, associative arrays
Abandons enclosure syntax used to structure data hierarchy in other languages
	Examples: Brackets, braces, open/close tags
Uses outline indentation to maintain data hierarchy structures



YAML File Syntax
	Optional document markers:
		Start of document: ---
		End of document: ...
	Data structures represented in outline format
	Space characters used for indentation
	Indentation rules:
		Elements at same level in hierarchy must have same indentation
		Child elements must be indented further than parents
		No rules about exact number of spaces to use
	Optional: Insert blank lines for readability



Example: YAML File
---
title: 		My book
author:
    first_name:	John
    last_name:	Doe

publish_date: 	2016-01-01

chapters:
    - number:	1
      title:	Chapter 1 Title
      pages:	10

    - number:	1
      title:	Chapter 2 Title
      pages:	10

...




Ansible Playbooks: YAML files written in list format
	List items are key/value pairs
Optional:
	Initiate playbook with --- marker


Strings
	No requirement to enclose strings in quotation marks
		Even if string contains spaces
	Optional: Enclose string in single or double quotation marks
	Examples:
		this is a string
		'this is another string'
		"this is yet another a string"

	

Multiline String Methods
	Use |
		Preserves line returns within string:
		include_newlines: |
			Example Company
			123 Main Street
			Atlanta, GA 30303
	Use >
		Converts line returns to spaces
		Removes leading white spaces in lines
			Use to break long strings at space characters
			Spanning multiple lines promotes better readability
			fold_newlines: >
				This is
				a very long,
				long, long, long
				sentence.
		  


Dictionaries
	Other names for key/value data pair: Dictionary, hash, associative array
	To separate keys from values, use : followed by space:
	keys: value
	
	Dictionaries commonly expressed in indented block format:
	---
		name: Automation using Ansible
		code: MYCODE407
	Optional: Express dictionaries in inline block format
		Enclose multiple key/value pairs between curly brackets
		Separate pairs with , followed by space:
		---
		{name: Automation using Ansible, code: MYCODE407}

  
 
Lists
	Lists in YAML = arrays in other languages
	To represent list, precede each item with - followed by space:
	---
		- red
		- green
		- blue
	Optional: Express lists in inline format
		Enclose list items between square brackets
		To separate items, use , followed by space:
		---
		fruits:
			[red, green, blue]
